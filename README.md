Student Blueprint LWC

The Student Blueprint LWC is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component that allows students to plan their class schedules and track how many hours they will be spending on their classes each week. With this tool, students can easily see how their class schedules will impact their available time and make adjustments as needed to ensure they are able to manage their time effectively.

To use the Student Blueprint LWC, students must first create an account using Salesforce Communities. Once they have an account, they can log in and begin adding classes to their schedule. The LWC will automatically track the estimated amount of time each class will take up each week and provide a visual gauge that shows the student how many hours they will be spending on their classes.

On the backend, Salesforce tracks all of the information that students input as records, which can be used by counselors to help guide students in their time management.

With the Student Blueprint LWC, students can easily plan their class schedules and stay on top of their time management, ensuring they have the time and energy to focus on their studies and succeed in their academic pursuits.
